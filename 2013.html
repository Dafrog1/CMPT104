      Faker Takes Center Stage
    </h1>
    <p>
      Going into the 2013 world chapionship SKT T1 did have 
      some hype around them especcially star rookie midlaner 
      Faker. Groupstage would see SKT only drop 1 game to 
      chinese representatives OMG Although they would also 
      claim a win over the chinese team. In the playoff 
      bracket t1 would sweep over Taiwans Gama Bears 
      play a tight series against regional rivals Najin Sword. 
      SKT would match up against China's Royal Club the 
      tournament favoriets in the grand finals and would 
      sweep aside the lpl representatives earning the 
      organization its first world title.

      The 2013 rooster was built up of talented rookies 
      and designed to play around solo que star and Midlaner 
      Faker. after the team strugled in 2014 toplaner Impact 
      would go on to become a star player in North America 
      ADC Piglet would follow with mixed success while support 
      PoohManDu would take a trip to Europe. Bengi and Faker 
      would be the only hold outs of the roster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faker would be seen as the star he was and claimed the 
      title as best midlaner in the world from the English Casters.
      This tournament would establish Korea as a higly competative force on the International scene.
