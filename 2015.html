      After a disapointing 2014 and the dissolvment of sister teams SKT would take Bengi and Faker
      and combine them with their sister teams side laners Toplaner 
      Marin, Botlaner Bang, and Support Wolf. Despite Faker's status they would 
      also retain Midlaner Easyhoon who would split time with Faker.

      Eventually at the world championships Faker would claim 
      the main starting spot. While he had previously been known for 
      more flashy assasin characters, recent changes mean
      they had been rendered mostly obsolete forcing faker to 
      adapt, and adapt he did. 2015 was defined by Fakers Ryze that 
      steamrolled the entire tournament.

      Although Faker was a important piece toplaner Marin would get the 
      Worlds MVP trouphy and was considered the main carry of the roster 
      for most of the year. Marin would get picked up by a Chinese team 
      in the offseason that offered him a decently large sum.
