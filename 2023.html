      T1 vs the LPL
    </h1>
    <p>
      unfortunatly 2017 would see t1 lose at the world stage 
      for the first time ever. a disapointinlgy quick 3-0 for the 
      2016 runner up Samsung Galaxy. This loss would unfortunatly 
      start a dark era for T1 Failing to reach worlds in 2018 and 2020. 
      they would get to semifinals in 2019 and 2021 before returning to the 
      finals in 2022 with the roster of Zeus, Oner, Faker, Gumayusi, and Keria 
      affectionatly refered to by fans as ZOFGK. The favorites in 2022 
      they would go the full 5 games but the dark horse DRX would 
      take the cup. 
    </p>

    <p>
      While 2022 may have given fans hope 2023 was unfortunatly uneasy. 
      Halfway though summer star midlaner Faker was benched due 
      to a wrist injury though qualification chances up into the air. 
      Luckly Faker would make his return not only getting his team into 
      the regional playoffs but getting them secondplace and a trip to worlds.
      After a 3-1 including a victory over china's BLG to advance T1 would find 
      themselves as the only non Chinese team left with 3 advanced and 
      1 waiting to take them on in Quarters. T1 would sweep aside LNG to 
      get to semifinals and stare down tournament favoirtes JDG and the man who ended 
      their dynasty Ruler. T1 and JDG would trade games 1 and 2 and deep into game 3 JDG look 
      poised to win the game before Faker found an angle to eliminate Ruler and T1 took game 3 
      and 4 advancing to finals. Finals would see t1 vs another darkhorse Weibo 
      and their star toplaner TheShy but nothing would stop them as they stomped the LPL's 
      last hope and claimed the organizations and fakers 4th worlds title.

      that despite the hardships he could still do it.
